If you haven't tried [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org), you should really check it out, now! Kotlin gives us lambdas, null safety, better generics and many other features that help us write safe and concise code. Its seamless interoperability with Java, first-class IDE support and small footprint make it a great choice for writing Android apps -- It's simply better than Java (even Java 8). For more details, check out [this comprehensive report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReS3ep-hjxWA8kZi0YqDbEhCqTt29hG8P44aA9W0DM8/edit?hl=en&forcehl=1) written by Jake Wharton.





How is Mirror related to Kotlin? If you've heard of [Mirror Sandbox]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/01/building-android-animations-mirror-sandbox-piecewise/), you'll guess it right. Yes! Mirror will soon be able to hot-swap Kotlin code (together with Java code and Android resources).
