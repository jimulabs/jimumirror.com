**Happy New Year Everyone!** Just wanted to give you a sneak peek of what we've been working on lately. It's still in a state of flux but I think it looks quite promising!





Yes, with Mirror Sandbox we can **hot-swap Java code** and use Java code to populate views with mock data. This opens up a whole new class of opportunities of what you can do with Mirror (I'll update you with details a bit later).





According to my unscientific tests with a sample project (and the [iosched2014 app](https://github.com/google/iosched)), it takes 4-10 seconds to see changes on the device -- slower than normal resource updates with Mirror but faster than building and deploying the whole APK!





Watch the video below and let us know what you think. (The text entry portion of the video was sped up but the waiting and animations were not. You can compare the blinking speed of the cursor.)

Mirror Sandbox will be in private beta soon. If you want to give it a try before the public release, be sure to request an invitation below.
