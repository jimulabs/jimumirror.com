We had some fun playing with Mirror Sandbox and the open-source game [Replica Island](http://replicaisland.net/).





Just watch the screencast below and you'll see.  The source code of the game (with Mirror files and a few lines of modification) is available on [Github](https://github.com/jimulabs/replica-island-gradle).
