# Teaming up with the Big Android BBQ





Hey everyone,





The [Big Android BBQ](www.bigandroidbbq.com/) is coming up in Hurst, Texas, October 16-18. Our team will be attending, and we're excited to meet up with others in the Android community. Linton and I will also be [giving a talk](http://news.bigandroidbbq.com/2014/09/speaker-spotlight-linton-ye.html) about the Android design/development workflow and how tools can improve it.





Every year BABBQ chooses a charity to support through donations; this is a wonderful way for the community to get together and contribute to groups doing important work. This year the cause is [Rapha House](http://www.raphahouse.org/about). Rapha House rescues trafficked and exploited children and provides them with safehouses, support, and training, with the eventual goal of helping them find a free, sustainable future.





We're excited to see conferences like BABBQ making charity an aspect of our community, and we'd like to help. From now until the BBQ jimu Labs will be collecting 50% of our revenue from sales of our product, [Mirror](/), and donating it to Rapha House at BABBQ. If you've been considering purchasing Mirror, now is a good time to do so while donating to a great cause at the same time. If you aren't interested in Mirror or already have a license, we encourage you to make a donation yourself, either directly [on the Rapha House website](https://www.raphahouse.org/take-action/donate) or in person at BABBQ.





If you haven't signed up for the conference yet but would like to, we've also got a little bonus for you from the BABBQ team. If you register for the conference using the discount code "jimulabs", you'll get 20% off your registration price!





Anyway, we're looking forward to meeting you there, talking Android, and eating delicious Texas BBQ. See you soon!





Matt and Linton
