Just cross-posting a [thread](https://plus.google.com/105955309246186974515/posts/QM1WKcgJ36C) on the Android development Google+ community:

We've done some testing to see how many devices Mirror can support at the same time. I was holding my breath when Matt was doing this, but it turned out to work really well with 16 devices. We wanted to try more devices but our newly bought USB hubs both broke after a few uses. too bad..





In the video we only showed theme changes through modifying AndroidManifest.xml because that's probably the more noticeable thing for a video like this. Of course changing other things worked too.

BTW: Excuse my unclear voiceover in the video. :)ï»¿
