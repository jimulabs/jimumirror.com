jimu Labs collects a small amount of information from our users in order to improve our products. We collect limited, anonymous data about how you use the Mirror app. We do not collect any information about the projects you work on with Mirror, such as source code or compiled code, unless you intentionally and specifically send it to us. In addition, we collect email addresses that you explicitly provide so we can contact you, and we collect responses to surveys you fill out.





We don't give or sell any information that we collect from our users to any other company or any individual that is not affiliated with jimu Labs. We only use this information to figure out what our users find useful and how we can make our tools better.





This policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on December 12, 2013. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or how we handle your data, please get in touch: [support@jimulabs.com](mailto:support@jimulabs.com)
