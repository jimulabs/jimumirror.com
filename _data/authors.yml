    description: I'm a software developer and am about to complete my Computer Science degree at the University of Victoria. I think software can transform the way people work and am interested in developing tools that do so. I've been working on jimu since 2011 building the backend app generator. When not in front of a screen I like to spend my time running, rock climbing, and reading.
