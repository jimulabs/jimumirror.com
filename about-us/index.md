<p>We are a small team of hackers passionate about helping people turn their ideas into working software as quickly as possible. We believe, just as reading and writing, the majority of the population on this planet should be able to understand and create software. We are taking baby steps towards this dream. Lately we are building UI design integration tools, i.e. tools that help UI designers and developers turn design into working software.</p>
