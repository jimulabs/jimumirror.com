### Method 1: Installing from JetBrains plugin repository





The easiest way to install Mirror into Android Studio is from JetBrains' plugin repository. When starting Android Studio, just select `Configure => Plugins => Browse repositories...`, and then enter "jimu Mirror", click "Install plugin". You'll be asked to restart Android Studio and then you are all set!





Below are screenshots of this process:

### Method 2: Installing from downloaded .zip file









You can also [download the zip file](/mirror-downloads/) and install it. Remember, DO NOT extract the .zip file, or else you'll get an error. Most steps are the same as method 1, just choose `Install plugin from disk...` and pick the downloaded .zip file.
